Gonna try out using Github Pages as my go-to, blogging site for a while and see how I feel about it. After all, there is no reason to NOT use it and it provides literally everything I want in a fast, easy to use, configurable, and scalable method. I've grown sort of weary of most other website software and applications these days with the literal enshittification of the entire internet at this point and right now I just want things that work, to keep working, without everyone and their brother trying to capitialize it all to death. This way, I'm not reliant on too many factors beyond my control and if anything does change and I dislike it, moving the site is just as easy as downloading an archive and uploading it someplace else. Winner winner!
