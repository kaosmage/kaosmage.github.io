                    <p>Hello friends! I know it has been a while since I've posted any useful updates around here but I've been tweaking a lot of the structural stuff and then I've also been busy IRL which has simply gotten in the way of everything. I will be having some work end up here very soon. In the mean time, I'm going to start using this place to blog about my fandom writing projects in somewhere that is isn't either Ao3 or Tumblr (as of now lol) Let's see how this little project of mine goes, eh? See ya soon!</p>
